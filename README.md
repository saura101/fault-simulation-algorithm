# Fault_Simulation

## Deductive Fault Simulation Model for digital circuits
1. A given circuit (without fan-out stem or branches) is taken as an input from Circuit.txt file
2. Implementing the given circuit as a graph data structure
3. Listing out the set of Fault lists detected by a given set of test vectors
4. Calculating percentage fault detection
